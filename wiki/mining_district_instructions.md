title: Mining District File Metadata Entry and Scanning
---

## Mining district files

### Metadata entry
See the documentation folder on the GBSSRL drive for detailed instructions.

### Scanning

Current files can go in this folder: G:/MININGDIST/NGGDPP 2019
1.	Make your own file under this master folder with “yourname_WORKING”
  a.	This is the folder for your work in progress
  b.	Move the documents to tif_done and pdf_done when you have pdf’ed the files
  c.	PDF files should be named ID_district#.pdf
2.	Create a folder within the current grant year and name it the ID of what you are scanning
3.	Each page should be titled with the number of the page and be three full digits (eg if it is the first document, the name should be 001.tif)
4.	The first page should always be the folder cover, the box, or whatever is holding the materials
5.	Scans should be at 300DPI TIFFs (uncompressed) for 2019, we will upgrade to 400DPI for 2020’s grant
6.	There are several scanners depending on the size of the papers – there’s a small document scanner which does 8.5x11, or 11x17, a flatbed scanner for larger documents, and another scanner for poster sized documents. Scan the items in order to make sure they are in the same order in the file system
7.	Don’t worry about cropping the TIFFs, but do make sure that the entire page is complete

Notes:
IDs for big maps (e.g. statewide) are in the 7000’s, but others are in the 6000’s
