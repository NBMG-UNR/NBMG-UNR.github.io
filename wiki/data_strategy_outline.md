### Data management goals at NBMG

Our data management strategy will ensure that data are:

**High-quality**
-   Define and apply quality assurance and quality control procedures for all
    data to ensure data quality and integrity

-   Create a single point of truth for data housed within NBMG

**Reproducible and Well-described**
-   Provide high-quality descriptive metadata for all datasets

-   Data and services should be described well enough to be used without expert
    assistance

**Accessible and Discoverable**
-   Data and metadata should be available and searchable on the web

-   Disseminate data to the public and scientific community in user-friendly web
    portals

**Secure**
-   Build access and management systems to ensure data security

-   Ensure that sensitive data are protected accordingly and data are only
    available to appropriate users

**Preserved**
-   Maintain edit and versioning history for all data within the system

-   Data should be available and understandable â€“ if the data owner leaves the
    department, others should still be able to retrieve and understand what the
    data are and how they were created

-   Personal and research data that are not actively being used or accessed
    should be archived in the appropriate location, whether in University hosted
    cloud (Nevada Box) or through library services

**Compliant**
-   Compliant with data standards or grant requirements when Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC) and Geoscience Markup Language (GeoSciML)

-   Structurally and semantically interoperable with industry standards

---
Data management practices should promote:

**Maintainability**
-   Long-term costs should be minimized by using open-source software when
    possible

-   Any tools or software created should be versioned and documented so that
    others could maintain it in the future

-   Newly implemented systems should strive to be as simple as possible while
    still being

**Sustainable and reproducible workflows**
-   Create data workflows for adding to existing datasets and quickly making
    data available online

-   Allow multiple users to simultaneously access and edit GIS data in-house

-   Create input portals to facilitate data submission to NBMG

**Redundancy and reliability**
-   All data on server should be backed up, back-ups will be customized
    depending on data IO

-   In-house server uptime for file shares is a priority
