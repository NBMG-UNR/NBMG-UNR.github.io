# Welcome to the NBMG Documentation Library

This website is the first iteration of an effort to consolidate and organize all of NBMG's documentation. Additionally, updates and meeting notes may be hosted in the "Posts" section of the page. Navigate to various pages using the toolbar to the left, and within pages using the dynamic navigation at the top of each page. You may also search documentation using the "Search" bar on the top right.

To add a new post or edit this wiki, you need a github account. You can also email the curator of the wiki (eodean@unr.edu) directly with a MS word, text document, or markdown document that you would like updated.

**Note on contributing:** This is a public site, so do not post any sensitive or proprietary information. Instead, provide links to files within the firewall (for example, on our file share server).
