### Data Entry of GBSSRL Materials:

- All entries need to be double-checked at first entry.  Eliminate errors early.
- Location information is particularly important to get correct. If locations are uncertain, please consult the physical curator.
- Please fill out all columns instructed to do so by the digital curator.
- Enter comments related to data entry, scanning, or otherwise into the metadata file.
- Please keep a log of entries or rows entered.

### Scanning GBSSRL Materials:

- Always treat original materials with the utmost care as not to damage or degrade them.
- Carefully examine the feature to be scanned for completeness, correct page orientations, and devising a scanning strategy. Note any problems, such as missing pages.
- Label carefully and double check for label accuracy and main association (e.g., mine name).
- Use the small scanner or copier for 81/2 x 11 inch items, photographs, and figures; use the large format scanner for oversized sheets and maps.
- Scan material accurately and completely. TIFF format is used for archiving and pdf format is used for web posting. Both formats should be made at the time of scanning.
- Assure the quality of the scanned product. For example, are all the pages scanned and oriented correctly? Is the scanned version legible? Correct any problems and comment on any insurmountable problems.

### Filing GBSSRL Materials:

- Any activities related to filing library materials in the warehouse must be cleared with the Physical Curator.
- The correct orientation of a box, etc. must be determined, such that the box, etc. can be identified while in a shelved position.
- Be Careful! Handle boxes and other Library materials carefully as not to spill the contents. Boxes can be fragile and their corners can deteriorate, making them vulnerable to failure. Report potential problems with boxes immediately to the Physical Curator, prior to moving them.
- Carefully note and report the location of the sample. Double check this location to be accurate.

### Peer Review

Each accessioned document should be quickly peer-reviewed for metadata and scanning quality.

**Metadata**

1. Check that all spelling is correct
2. Check that the title and authors match the document
3. Briefly check the district, district number, and county

**Scanned document**

1. View the scanned document and ensure that the scanned image matches the document
2. Ensure there is no dust or particles visible on the scanned image
3. Ensure that the scanned image is correctly aligned
4. Ensure that the scanned image is then saved in the appropriate location at the appropriate resolution
